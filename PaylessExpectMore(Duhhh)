I have heard so many times that person X, Y left the company and all the bad code was written by that X, Y.
But the question is how often do person X, Y gets to rewrite that same code in a better way?
If you pay for a senior who specialist that one subject and that one language; yes, you might achieve that "perfection".
But if you ask a junior developer and expect perfection that was just ... 
And why you have to blame on the person who left the company a bad person?
What if some day, you were the one that left an another company and everyone say that was your bad code?

Just a thought. Some tend do be less bias and say, that was only his few days project... or misc. 
But I think is still valid for most part.
